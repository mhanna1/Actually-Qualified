  <h3 align="center" style="color:#000000">Amazon Web Services</h3>

  <p align="justify">The mission of this site is to demonstrate proficiency in both Ruby, Ruby on Rails and
    cloud adminstration. In this case the cloud is Amazon Web Services.</p>

  <p align="justify">This Ruby on Rails application is hosted on an Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-48-generic x86_64) EC2 instance. The native AWS instance domain name is
    <a href="http://ec2-52-7-56-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com/mission" style="color:#000000"><u>http://ec2-52-7-56-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com</u></a>.
    The <a href="http://actually-qualified.com/mission" style="color:#000000"><u>http://actually-qualified.com</u></a> domain name is routed
    using AWS "Route 53" service. Being able to click on a link whose top level domain is amazonaws.com proves
    that the site is hosted on the Amazon AWS cloud service.

  <p align="justify">AWS is the wave of the future. Hostng your own steel is just no longer the way to go.</p>

  <p align="justify">Cloud Case Study ... Zynga</p>
  <p align="justify">Zynga is a huge online game site. Zynga is considered the poster child for a company that in 2012
    moved from a pure public cloud model, using AWS to a hybrid model, choosing to complement
    Amazon with its own internal data center. Regardless of the company, industry or vertical,
    this is a massive-scale operation that is realizing significant management efficiencies.
    To set some context around the levels of scale we are talking about, here are some pretty
    incredible business metrics around the adoption of Zynga and social gaming.

  <ul>
    <li>Zynga has >250m monthly active users globally.
    <li>It has developed seven of the top 10 games on Facebook.
    <li>Five new players join Zynga every second.
    <li>Ten percent of the world's Internet population plays Zynga games every month.
    <li>Cityville went from 0 to 100m users in 40 days.
    <li>If Farmville were a country, it would be fifth largest in the world.
    <li>One in five Americans play social games.
    <li>Farmville was the inflection point in the business. The game grew to 25m daus (daily active users) in five
      months.
    <li>RightScale is a very important component of the infrastructure, across both the public and private cloud
      implementations, for scale, flexability, provisioning and monitoring.
    <li>It built own private cloud, the zCloud (internal Zynga private cloud):
    <li>When the game growth slope is vertical, it can’t build fast enough.
    <li>When growth is less than vertical, it can build the system to meet this demand.
    <li>It uses industry-standard servers and hypervisors (xen, kvm).
    <li>It creates Amazon-like security zones.
    <li>It's infrastructure is integrated with RightScale.
    <li>The zCloud works on an IP routed network and is required to scale, it just doesn’t scale on layer 2 switches.
  </ul>
  <h3 align="center" style="color:#000000">Classic Mistake</h3>

  <p align="justify">Zynga had used Amazon Web Services exclusively prior to 2012, but Zynga management
    thought they could do better (i.e. save money) with their own hybrid center.</p>

  <p align="justify">
    In May 2015 it was announced that after spending $100 million dollars Zynga is abandoning their own data
    centers and moving back to Amazon Web Services as a cost cutting move. This cost saving move will cost over
    300 people their jobs at Zynga. <br> see...&nbsp;http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/app-cloud/zynga-abandons-data-centers-returns-to-aws/93952.fullarticle
  </p>

  <p>
    If your company is already using Amazon Web Services, then you made a very smart move.
    If not and you were now thinking about it. Good thinking and I would
    love to help you in the transition and operation of your cloud based solutions.
