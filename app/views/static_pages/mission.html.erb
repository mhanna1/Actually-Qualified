  <p align="justify">The purpose of this site is to demonstrate my proficiency with Ruby on Rails
    and cloud administration. In this case the cloud is Amazon Web Services.</p>

  <h4>Web Site Features</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The site has been designed with a user database.</li>
    <li>The main reason for employers to login is to demonstrate the user login features.</li>

    <li>The new user is sent an email to verify that they have access to the email address.</li>
    <li>The email has a user account activation link.</li>
    <li>The new user is authenticated only after they click on the activation link.</li>
    <li>The web site has page by page access control, some pages like the home page can be viewed by anyone,
      where as only logged in users wll be able to view the link to my resume page.</li>
    <li>The user information is stored in a "mySQL database".</li>
  </ul>

  <p align="justify">Technologies used in building this application were, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and a RDS hosted
    "mySQL database". This means your development system and your
    production system databases can be served from a common cloud location.</p>

  <p align="justify">The gems used in this Ruby on Rails application are ... aws-sdk, aws-ses, bcrypt, bootstrap-sass,
    bootstrap-will_paginate, coffee-rails, faker, figaro, guard-minitest, jbuilder, jquery-rails,
    json, mini_backtrace, minitest-reporters, mysql3, rails,
    rspec, sass-rails, sdoc, spring, turbolinks, uglifier, web-consol, and will_paginate</p>

  <p align="justify">This web site is hosted on a Ubuntu EC2 instance. The native AWS instance domain name is
    <a href="http://ec2-52-7-56-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com/mission" style="color:#000000"><u>http://ec2-52-7-56-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com</u></a>.
    The <a href="http://actually-qualified.com/mission" style="color:#000000"><u>http://actually-qualified.com</u></a>
    domain name is routed using AWS "Route 53" service. Being able to click on a link whose top
    level domain is amazonaws.com proves
    that the site is hosted on the Amazon AWS cloud service.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">Phusion Passenger is a robust module for Apache and Nginx servers,
    and is preferred by many over any other module for deploying web apps developed using the Rails framework.
    Apache and Nginx are widely adopted web servers. Although Apache is the best known process based web server,
    Nginx is most suited if youâ€™re in need of a fast, and responsive server.
    It performs miracles when the server is under heavy load.
    The web site is using Phusion Passenger in front of the Nginx server.
